<p>We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset">Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset</a></p>

<p>Besides the obvious variables of <code>title</code>, <code>genre</code>, <code>director</code>, <code>year</code>, and <code>duration</code>, the rest of the variables are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gross</code> : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation</li>
<li><code>budget</code>: The movieâ€™s budget</li>
<li><code>cast_facebook_likes</code>: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received</li>
<li><code>votes</code>: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB</li>
<li><code>reviews</code>: the number of reviews for that movie</li>
<li><code>rating</code>: IMDB average rating</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>skim(movies)</code></pre>
<p>Skimming allows us to see if there are missing values. We can conclude that this is not the case. Moreover, we found that the data consists of 2961 observations across 11 variables. Considering there are 2907 unique titles, we can conclude that there are 54 non-unique movie titles. Furthermore, it is not surprising that there are numerous duplicates for the other variables such as genre and director, as genres consist of more than 1 movie and movie directors often direct more than 1 movie.</p>

We chose to plot histograms, as this shows us both the count of movies as well as the distributions. However, for some genres, the data provided is insufficient to make any conclusions (For example: Family, Romance, Sci-fi,). We adjusted the bins to allow for a clearer representation of the data.</p>

<p>After plotting the two variables and running a correlation test, it is clear that, though the correlation is low at 0.213, it is significant (with a p&lt;0.01). This means that having a cast with many facebook like affects the gross revenue, but not too much</p>
<p><em>Examine the relationship between <code>gross</code> and <code>budget</code>. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.</em></p>

<p>Once more, we ran a scatterplot as well as a correlation test. This time too the result was highly significant (p&lt;0.01), but the correlation was much higher at 0.641. This means that spending more on the production of the movie has quite a large effect on its gross revenue.</p>

<pre><code>##

## sample estimates:

## 0.269</code></pre>
<p>Running a correlation test between gross returns and movie ratings reveals that there is a small, but significant positive correlation between the both (cor=0.269, p&lt;0.01). However, when we divide the movies per genre and put this correlation in a scatterplot, we can notice a discrepancy within genres. Due to the lack of data, we can omit genres such as family, musical, romance, thriller, western, etc. However, even within the genres with many data points, there is a significant difference in correlation coefficients. Action movies clearly have the highest correlation between movie ratings and the gross revenue, whilst genres like comedy, crime and drama are much less affected. This can possibly be explained by action movies relying heavily on special effects and expensive CGI. Meanwhile, dramas, comedies and crime do not necessarily need this budget to convey the message. Moreover, there are more subsections within the genres comedy, crime and drama, compared to action. For the former, the audiences are likely very different and rate movies on a different scale, based on more subjective factors.</p>
